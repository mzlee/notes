  - Write a malicious binary
    - Modify and compile evince (and associated buffer overflow)
  - What about HDFS?
    - Err...that's a lot of work for one month
    - But maybe this is necessary...
  - Applications:
    - DokuWiki
    - Viewer App, (old evince), wrapper application
    - sshd/ssh-client, login
  - What do we want to show?
    - Decentralized access control is good
      - HDFS or other decentralized service
    - Privilege separation without root (and in a little bit of code)
      - Chromium, evince, Acrobat Reader
    - File and directory sharing
      - Dropbox?  Would that even work?
    - Server application, resources for many users
      - DokuWiki
