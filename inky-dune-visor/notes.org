* Direction One

** Don't trust your operating system
   


** Don't trust the VMM underneath it either

* Direction Two

** Nested or not, it's kind of the same
   
How does this work?  We have an application that can handle its own
page table and pagefaults.  We have a guest OS which handles a lot of
system calls we don't care about.  We have the hypervisor which
allocates the memory we need for the inky-dune process.
