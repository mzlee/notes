* How do you make an untraceable email?
  + What do we want to prevent?
    Leaking the data and the metadata.
  + How?
    # Encrypt the message with a random symmetric key.
    # Encrypt the symmetric key with a public key.
    # 

* What does this look like?
  + Alice and Bob have private keys.  The public key rotates.
  + 
  + Exchange the address out of band

* Email server accessible over a Tor hidden service.


* Service keeps a directory of current addresses.

* As a service, what will I see?
  + An IP address
  + A timestamp
  + A blob of data
  + When and how the blob of data moves
