* What is an attack model?
** Forensic Deniability
   The "attacker" gets access to the system in some capacity
   (depending on strength of the attacker) and tries to determine
   whether or not a particular "action" was taken (where action could
   be loading a particular webpage, running an application, etc).

   The attacker wins if he can distinguish between two executions with
   one differing program.

   A harder problem would be to try to make some guarantee about a
   non-interference property.

* Where does data lie around?
  + Application Level
    - Swapped to disk
    - Memory Dump
    - Temporary Files
    - Dynamic Allocation
  + Kernel
    - Buffer Cache
    - Key Cache
    - DMA Buffers
  + General Data Structures
    - Circular queues
    - I/O buffers
    - Strings
** GUI Programs vs. Command Line
   There's an inherent difference due to the event loop in GUI
   programs [Garbage].  GUI event loops sit at the top of the stack
   and occansionally do work.  This results in a different access
   pattern and possibly leaked information on the stack.
** Specific Examples
*** Mozilla 1.0 [WSS]
    + Kernel random number generator
    + XFree86 event queue
    + Kernel socket Buffers
    + Mozilla strings
    + Kernel tty buffers
*** Apache and Perl [WSS]
    + Kernel packet buffers
    + Apache input buffers
    + Apache output buffer
    + Kernel pipe buffer
    + Perl file input buffer
    + Perl string buffers
*** Emacs [WSS]
    + Kernel random number generator
    + Global variable: kbd_buffer
    + Global variable: recent_keys
    + Lisp string in emacs
    + Stack
    + Three kernel buffers: a flip buffer, tty, and ipc to shell
      subprocess
*** Modern Browsers (Firefox 3.5) [Private Browse]
    + cert8.db: CA Certs, client certs, and settings
    + permissions.sqlite: site specific preferences
    + mimeTypes.rdf: Download actions for file types
    + SQlite databases - show an accessed timestamp
    + search.sqlite, search.json: Search Plugins
    + pluginreg.dat: Plugin registration
    + Browser extensions can also leak data
*** Databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, IBM DB2, SQLite)
    + Not all operations properly remove data:
    + DELETE might not physically overwrite data
    + UPDATE might preserve the old value

* Terms from various papers
** Data Lifetime [WSS, Garbage]
   + Ideal Data Lifetime
   + Secure Deallocation Data Lifetime
   + Natural Data Lifetime
** Forensically Transparent System [Database]
   + "All data retained by the system should be accessible through a
      legitimate interface and it should not be possible to recover
      hidden data through inspection of system state." (Page 92)
** Slack Data
   Data that is not accessible through normal interfaces but can still
   be recovered for whatever purposes.
   + Database Slack
   + File System Slack
